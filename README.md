# HTML, CSS and JavaScript test assignment

## Start the project

The archive with files should be unpacked locally and the root folder of the project should be opened using VScode or other IDE. Run the index.html file

Or you can view the project on GitHub by going to [this gh page](https://maksymchukhrai.github.io/Conveyor-test-task/).

## Project Description

The layout is made according to Figma layout for mobile devices 360px and PC - 1920px. The break point for PC is 1200px.

## Fonts. 
The standard set of fonts 'Montserrat', Arial, sans-serif from Google fonts library was used 
'SF Pro Text', -font for iOS devices - is installed and connected locally in the project and may be incorrectly displayed on Windows devices. In case of incorrect display on these devices, it is replaced by a standard similar installed font.

## Icons and images
All svg icons are made as a sprite.svg file. Some png icons are saved for Java Script purposes. For maximum speed of page loading all context images were optimised by format, weight and size using [Squoosh](https://squoosh.app/) service. As a result, all graphic elements of the project take up to 1 mb in total.

## Interactive elements.
Implemented and connected Swiper.js library slider without using additional frameworks. Basic functions are connected and configured. Setup file js\slider.js It should be noted that for the implementation of layout goals, such as synchronisation of two different sliders, the current library is not suitable. It is necessary to implement a custom separately written slider, which is also possible on behalf of the employer within a reasonable period of time.

## Conveyor Belt Width, in
When hovering the cursor over all "Info" icons on all places on the page, additional messages with product details appear.
Simulated standard size selection buttons are implemented. When clicking on the "Custom" button, the user can select the desired width of the conveyor via the additional buttons that appear in 1 inch increments. When the "Custom" button is clicked again, the selection button block is hidden. This functionality is written in the js\custom-belt-width.js file

## Bed Section Length, in
Conveyor section length selection buttons are implemented. Increment/decrement switches sizes in 5 inch increments. This functionality is written in the js file\increm-decrem-length.js
The user can order additional options by ticking the necessary ones in the checkbox. This checkbox is implemented using the js\checkbox.js file. Clicking on the container with the desired option replaces the icon from the layout.

## Final cost calculation.
In the order confirmation block the functionality of calculating the cost of the product depending on the number of ordered units is implemented. The cost of a unit is a multiple of the one stated in the layout - $22360

## Contacts

I hope that this test assignment will show a sufficient level of knowledge of JS, HTML, CSS.

I am ready to answer any additional questions.
I am waiting for your feedback.
